This project is a small little coffee ordering site that allows users to play 2d platformer games in the browser by running it within the pygame module
THe coffee side of things allows the user to make a customization to the order and send it to a spreadsheet and shows it in a database and convert that to a spreadsheet usable in any csv program like excel or libre office tools.
Flask handles the http request given from the html documents in the project.
Please make sure you have the necessary modules installed in order for your device to run the project.
